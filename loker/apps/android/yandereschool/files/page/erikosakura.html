<h3>Eriko Sakura</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>Eriko is a teenage girl with an average height and build. She has straight, short, carrot-orange hair, only reaching down to her neck, with above the eyebrow bangs. She has a noticeably slim and womanly figure and dark blue eyes. Her face is also rather mature compared to her friend, and especially Akari, though she usually appears sleepy. She has a fair and light complexion that is prone to blushing.</p>

<h3>Personality</h3>

Even when being approached by Akari, who she and Meisa appear to dislike, she continues smiling as it seems to be a default facial expression.
