<p>"Game Over's are the screens that cause you to lose the game"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Scared Your Love</h3>
<p>When you confess to Makio Sono after murdering anyone other than your rivals, you will say to him, "I killed her for you!". This will scare him and induce a game over.</p>
<p>When you drag a body, murder, or are seen with a weapon by a corpse around Makio, he will say, "You Monster!" and cause a game over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Caught by the Teacher</h3>
<p>When a teacher witnesses Akari committing murder or dragging a corpse, they will attempt to apprehend her immediately.</p>
<p>The teacher will chokehold Akari, attempting to cause her to pass out. This will cause a game over.</p>
<p>This rule applies to justice-minded students as well.</p>
