<h3>Pushing Off the Roof</h3>
<p>Pushing off the roof is a murder elimination method in Yandere School.</p>
<p>You can push off the roofs only characters who can follow you (Angelina Ivanova), Tomio Nakano and the head of the computer club (who's talking with him) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Homicide</h3>
<p>Homicide is the first elimination method to be added to the game so far, and is the only method to eliminate a rival.</p>
<p>If you murder anyone besides your rivals (in a Chapter, not a Nightmare) then you will get a Game Over, as you can't hide your crime.</p>
<p>Murder can be performed with various weapons throughout the school. You can use them to attack other NPCs (except Makio Sono). You can then dispose of corpses by burying them in the garden. </p>
