<h3>Evidence</h3>
<p>You cannot win the game if you do not dispose of the rival's corpse. You will not be able to hide evidence for any other murders committed besides your rival.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Reputation</h3>
<p>If students see Akari carrying a dangerous weapon, they will see her as suspicious, but this will not damage her reputation.</p>
<p>If Makio sees Akari holding a weapon, he won't take notice and you won't get a game over unless you murdered someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Sanity</h3>
<p>You will not lose any sanity unless you murdered anyone other than your rival, which will cause you to scare your love when you try to confess.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
